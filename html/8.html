                    <p>How could we have let ourselves be so muzzled? How could we have so lost our pride and our freedom?</p>
                    <p>Consider: right now we have three Queensland University of Technology students being sued by an Aboriginal
                        staffer for racism &#x2014; though they complained against racism.</p>
                    <p>Yes, their crime was to write social media messages protesting at being kicked off computers that the
                        university insisted were only for Aboriginal students. This was &#x201C;segregation&#x201D;, they
                        said.
                    </p>
                    <p>And they&#x2019;re right. So we now have laws &#x2014; the Racial Discrimination Act &#x2014; that silence
                        students for protesting against discrimination.</p>
                    <p>Are we crazy?</p>
                    <p>And who would have dreamt that a Liberal government would be too gutless to change these wicked laws
                        for fear of seeming &#x201C;racist&#x201D; too?</p>

                    <p>Did you know that Attorney-General George Brandis even refused to indemnify these students to spare them
                        horrendous legal bills?</p>
                    <p>But in many other ways, we have let ourselves be stopped from saying what we think or reading what we&#x2019;d
                        like. We have let others decide for us what is fit to say and believe.</p>
                    <p>For instance, last year we let a rat-pack of student activists and academic unionists stop two Australian
                        universities from hiring a world-renowned academic, Professor Bjorn Lomborg.</p>
                    <p>Lomborg&#x2019;s sin? To correctly note that global-warming schemes wasted billions of dollars without
                        doing much good.</p>
                    <p>Ban him, howled the National Tertiary Education Union, for the thought crime of &#x201C;downgrading the
                        importance to the world of climate change mitigation&#x201D;.</p>
                    <p>Once again, this government &#x2014; this Liberal government &#x2014; surrendered. It gave in to this
                        lynch mob and stopped the funding for Lomborg, rather than insist on free inquiry in our universities.</p>
                    <p>How many more examples do you want?</p>
                    <p>Just last week, Greens leader Richard Di Natale, with the backing of the state-funded ABC, asked the
                        Australian Press Council to punish cartoonist Bill Leak for drawing a cartoon in <em>The Australian</em>                        which highlighted the shocking levels of child abuse in Aboriginal communities.</p>
                    <p>Worse, our Race Discrimination Commissioner, Tim Soutphommasane, actually urged Australians to complain
                        to his Human Rights Commission about Leak, so it could take legal action.</p>

                    <p>On it goes. This year, Tasmania&#x2019;s Anti-Discrimination Commission had the hide to order Australia&#x2019;s
                        Catholic bishops to show cause why they shouldn&#x2019;t be stopped from defending traditional marriage.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, the state-funded ABC and SBS &#x2014; both meant to be impartial &#x2014; scream abuse at
                        conservatives, to intimidate them into silence.</p>
                    <p>&#x201C;Dog-f---er&#x201D;, one ABC show called conservative Chris Kenny. &#x201C;Go f---yourself, Bill,&#x201D;
                        another SBS show jeered at Leak.</p>
                    <p>And, of course, the ABC, meant by law to be balanced in exchange for &#36;1 billion a year of taxpayers&#x2019;
                        money, has instead for years stopped conservatives from hosting any of its main current affairs shows.</p>
                    <p>Have we lost our brains or our guts? How could Australians have let themselves be shut up and shut down
                        like this?</p>
                    <p>But I should declare an interest. Two of my own articles were banned by the Federal Court for being too
                        upsetting to one.</p>
                    <p>Banned! Under that wicked Racial Discrimination Act again.</p>
                    <p>And now &#x201C;diversity&#x201D; officials in the ABC are actually trying to stifle diversity by demanding
                        the ABC not screen a documentary it commissioned in which Aboriginal MP Linda Burney and I politely
                        debate the government&#x2019;s plan to change our Constitution to divide us by race. These officials,
                        including the ABC&#x2019;s Bonner committee of Aboriginal representatives, insist the ABC should
                        not give me a platform to put the argument against this constitutional change. They claim I am a
                        &#x201C;racist&#x201D; for opposing things like that. They demand, therefore, that I not be heard
                        in case viewers are influenced or angered.</p>
                    <p>How can such arguments be seriously put in this country?</p>
                    <p>How can free speech be held in such contempt?</p>
                    <p>And that contempt is for you, too. Remember: the censors&#x2019; aim is not really to stop me speaking
                        but to stop you from hearing.</p>
                    <p>You see, they believe you are so savage that you cannot be trusted to hear me without smashing stuff.</p>
                    <p>But stop. As I said, just when all seemed lost, Australians started to revolt. Everywhere, I now hear
                        the cry: Enough!</p>
                    <p>In last month&#x2019;s election, 600,000 Australians voted for Pauline Hanson&#x2019;s One Nation in
                        the Senate &#x2014; many simply to protest against the bullying.</p>
                    <p>Another million people voted for other parties, including the Liberal Democrats, Family First and Derryn
                        Hinch, who had also promised to scrap the Racial Discrimination Act.</p>

                            Prime Minister Tony Abbott says he is sorry he caved in to pressure and reneged on his promise
                            to reform racial discrimination laws. Picture: Gary Ramage</figcaption>

                    <p>That&#x2019;s not all. On Friday, Tony Abbott said he was now sorry he caved in to pressure as prime
                        minister and reneged on his promise to reform those laws.</p>
                    <p>He made it clear he wouldn&#x2019;t make that mistake again if given the chance, protesting that &#x201C;our
                        parliament prefers to tolerate over-the-top prosecutions than to upset thin-skinned activists&#x201D;.</p>
                    <p>Abbott won&#x2019;t be without allies in wanting his rival, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, to change
                        the race act, either.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday, the Liberals&#x2019; WA branch also called for the law to be changed so it was no longer
                        unlawful to merely insult or offend someone with your opinion.</p>
                    <p>Many Liberal MPs &#x2014; including impressive newcomers James Paterson and Andrew Hastie, and conservative
                        warriors such as Cory Bernardi &#x2014; agree.</p>
                    <p>And Turnbull faces serious instability if he keeps stonewalling.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, he could even lose his leadership, with the forces for change gathering strength.</p>
                    <p>Also on Friday, News Corp Australia, the country&#x2019;s biggest newspaper group and publisher of this
                        paper, made clear it had had enough of this creeping censorship, too.</p>
                    <p>Speaking at the group&#x2019;s annual awards night, News Corp&#x2019;s international boss, Robert Thomson,
                        urged journalists, cartoonists and editors to fight political correctness and the enemies of free
                        speech.
                    </p>
                    <p>What&#x2019;s more, Leak was named the group&#x2019;s cartoonist of the year, and, Paul Whittaker, <em>The Australian&#x2019;s</em>                        editor-in-chief, passionately defended him.</p>
                    <p>If the Press Council and the Human Rights Commission try to punish Leak, they will buy a war with News
                        Corp and countless Australians who are now jack of our arrogant censors.</p>
                    <p>This assault by the Left on free speech has abused our intelligence and our freedom.</p>
                    <p>Australians, insulted and offended, are now saying they are as mad as hell and will not take this any
                        more.
                    </p>
                    <p>It&#x2019;s time to fight.</p>
