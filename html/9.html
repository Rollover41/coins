            <p>(a) the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another
                person or a group of people; and</p>

                allows people to make complaints to the Australian Human Rights Commission about unlawful acts. However,
                an unlawful act is not necessarily a criminal offence. Section 26 says that this Act does not make it an
                offence to do an act that is unlawful because of this Part, unless Part IV expressly says that the act is
                an offence.</p>
            <p>(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), an act is taken not to be done in private if it:</p>
            <p>(a) causes words, sounds, images or writing to be communicated to the public; or</p>
            <p>(b) is done in a public place; or</p>
            <p>(c) is done in the sight or hearing of people who are in a public place.</p>

            and either dismissing complaints, or initiating conciliation processes. If unresolved, matters can be taken to
            court. As of 2014, fewer than 5 per cent of complaints had gone court, and a majority of those have been dismissed.
