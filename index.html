                  <p>The federal government has announced a <a href="" https://www.attorneygeneral.gov.au/Mediareleases/Pages/2016/FourthQuarter/Parliamentary-inquiry-into-freedom-of-speech.aspx
                    "">parliamentary inquiry</a> into free speech and section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act.</p>

                  <p>So the time is right for a crash course on <a href="" http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/s18c.html
                    "">the law</a>, <a href="" http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/s18d.html "">its exemptions</a>,
                    and <a href="" http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ahrca1986373/ "">the powers of the Australian Human Rights Commission</a>.
                  </p>

                  <p>Let’s start with the basics.</p>

                  <h2>Can the Australian Human Rights Commission sue a person under 18C?</h2>

                  <p>No. It couldn’t even if it wanted to.</p>

                  <p>The parliamentary inquiry was announced in the wake of the Prior v QUT <a href="" https://castancentre.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/prior-v-qut.pdf
                    "">case</a>, in which the federal court <a href="" https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/nov/04/qut-computer-lab-racial-discrimination-lawsuit-thrown-out
                    "">dismissed claims</a> brought under section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act against three Queensland University
                    of Technology (QUT) students. </p>

                  <p>In that case, an Indigenous QUT staff member Cindy Prior <a href="" https://castancentre.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/prior-v-qut.pdf
                    "">alleged</a> that Facebook comments made by the students after they were ejected from a computer lab reserved for
                    Indigenous students breached section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act.</p>

                  <p>Following the decision, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull <a href="" http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/malcolm-turnbull-says-human-rights-commission-has-damaged-its-reputation-over-18c-and-must-reform-20161106-gsjc2i.html
                    "">told</a> the ABC that the Human Rights Commission:</p>

                  <blockquote>
                    <p>has done a great deal of harm to its credibility by bringing the case against the Queensland students.</p>
                  </blockquote>

                  <p>That may have left some people under the mistaken impression that the Commission sued the students. It did not, and could
                    not. </p>

                  <p>The Commission has no power to litigate in relation to an alleged breach of section 18C or any other provision of the
                    Racial Discrimination Act. Only a person alleging their own racial or ethnic group was vilified by statements made
                    in public can commence court proceedings. </p>

                  <p>That is exactly what happened in the Prior v QUT case. After the Commission terminated Prior’s complaint in August 2015,
                    having decided there was no reasonable prospect of the complaint being successfully conciliated, Cindy Prior exercised
                    her right to commence court proceedings. Her claim was summarily dismissed in relation to three of the named respondents.
                    Proceedings continue for others.</p>

                  <p>The Commission has been at pains to point out that they did not “bring the case” to court, saying that:</p>

                  <blockquote>
                    <p>At no stage does the Commission initiate or prosecute a complaint. </p>
                  </blockquote>

                  <p>In the QUT case, <a href="" http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/qut-race-case-the-punishment-is-the-process-says-alex-wood/news-story/af1c3975a427d1a6d04619347c5d6dbe
                    "">the Commission was criticised</a> for not communicating with all of the students involved, taking too long to attempt
                    to address the original complaint, and not terminating the complaint earlier. These criticisms should be assessed
                    on their merits and, as appropriate, lessons learned.</p>

                  <h2>Is the bar “set too low”?</h2>

                  <p>Not according to the courts. </p>

                  <p><a href="" http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/malcolm-turnbull-says-human-rights-commission-has-damaged-its-reputation-over-18c-and-must-reform-20161106-gsjc2i.html
                    "">Critics</a> of 18C have <a href="" https://www.google.com.au/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=qut%20bar%20set%20too%20low
                    "">suggested</a> the “bar is set too low” because section 18C uses the phrase “offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate”
                    to define the threshold for unlawful racial vilification. </p>

                  <p>In the Prior v QUT case, Judge Jarrett <a href="" https://castancentre.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/prior-v-qut.pdf "">found</a>        that the Facebook comments of two of the respondents did not meet the legislative threshold and therefore were not
                    unlawful. (In the case of the third respondent, the judge found that it could not be proven that the student had
                    been responsible for the allegedly vilifying Facebook comment.) </p>

                  <p>In stark contrast to the <a href="" http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/grace-collier/no-offence-intended-modern-rights-mean-fewer-rights-for-majority/news-story/d3e71cddd43cfa433d54aaff1cd514bb
                    "">regular attempts by some opponents</a> to generate hostility towards section 18C by saying it covers any offence,
                    the courts have consistently ruled that the bar is not low.</p>

                  <p>Previous <a href="" http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCA/2001/1007.html "">judgments</a> have clarified that breaching
                    18C requires conduct with</p>

                  <blockquote>
                    <p>profound and serious effects, not to be likened to mere slights. </p>
                  </blockquote>

                  <p>So the QUT decision confirms that the legislature and judiciary have made a fair assessment of where the line should
                    be drawn.</p>

                  <p>It’s also important to remember that <a href="" http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/rda1975202/s18d.html
                    "">section 18D</a> of the Act details exemptions to 18C, which covers anything said or done as part of an artistic
                    work or “any other genuine purpose in the public interest”.</p>

                  <h2>Has 18C always been a big issue?</h2>

                  <p>Not really. </p>

                  <p>Section 18C <a href="" http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/rha1995109/ "">was introduced in 1995</a> recognising
                    that racial vilification is a problem that could and should be tackled. </p>

                  <p>It has operated without much attention or fuss for over two decades. It is not a panacea, but it <a href="" http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UNSWLawJl/2016/18.html
                    "">has supported legal redress</a> in a modest number of instances where individuals and communities have been subjected
                    to racist abuse that none of us should have to endure.</p>

                  <p>Of the hundreds of instances of alleged racial vilification over the years, only three have been regarded as sufficiently
                    noteworthy to attract significant media attention and public comment.</p>

                  <p>One in 2011 involved journalist Andrew Bolt, who was <a href="" http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-09-28/bolt-found-guilty-of-breaching-discrimination-act/3025918
                    "">found</a> in the Federal Court to have breached the Act. Then there was the QUT case. The third, which centred
                    on a cartoon by Bill Leak, was recently <a href="" http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-11-12/eric-abetz-welcomes-bill-leak-cartoon-complaint-withdrawal/8020420
                    "">before the Commission and then subsequently withdrawn</a>. </p>

                  <p>Is there any other area of the law in which three controversial decisions in over 20 years would be regarded as a reason
                    for a parliamentary inquiry? </p>

                  <p>Or where one instance of summary dismissal is regarded as proof of a fatal flaw? What is it about laws designed to address
                    the harm caused by racist speech that makes some people so agitated?</p>

                  <p>Over the last 25 years only 1.8% of racial vilification complaints nationally <a href="" https://theconversation.com/explainer-how-do-australias-laws-on-hate-speech-work-in-practice-26105
                    "">have ended up in a court or tribunal for adjudication</a>. Court cases are the exception, not the rule.</p>

                  <p>The conciliation process overseen by the Australian Human Rights Commission (and equivalent bodies in the states and
                    territories) is confidential. This means the public rarely hears about the typical cases in which a racial vilification
                    complaint is resolved. </p>

                  <p>This reflects a decision taken many decades ago that, in the area of anti-discrimination, mediation-based dispute resolution
                    processes are preferable to protracted, expensive litigation in courts. Thousands of complainants and respondents
                    would agree.</p>

                  <h2>A strong symbolic message</h2>

                  <p>Section 18C is no more or less flawed than many other laws. Because it is limited to matters of substantial public harm,
                    it cannot be used to complain about having one’s feelings hurt. </p>

                  <p>Critics have called for the words “insult” and “offend” to be removed from section 18C. But this would likely have no
                    legal effect; remember, previous judgements have said that conduct must have “profound and serious effects” before
                    one can say 18C has been breached.</p>

                  <p>However, removing these words would send a troubling symbolic message to the communities that section 18C is supposed
                    to protect: that the government feels they should bear the burden of more harm so that others can have free speech.
                    Could there be a more wrong message to send at this time in our history?</p>

            <p> It may seem unfair to the 24 million Australians who have yet to master the pronunciation of the six tones of Lao, but
              as Thinethavone Soutphommasane often tells us, we should always call out racism when we see it.</p>
          </div>
            <p>&#x201C;If someone says to me they&#x2019;re not even going to try to pronounce my name, that doesn&#x2019;t necessarily
              send a good signal,&#x201D; the race relations commissioner told <i>The Australian Financial Review</i> in a revealing
              interview this month.</p>
            <p>&#x201C;It says that they&#x2019;re not even bothered to treat me with respect. How would they feel if they were told that
              every day &#x2014; that people weren&#x2019;t going to even try to pronounce their name?&#x201D;</p>
            <p>Just when you think the threshold for taking offence could not get lower, the salaried hand-wringers of the grievance industry
              prove you wrong. Every slight, real or imagined, is tendered as evidence of the bigotry eating away at our society.</p>
            <p>It is in the nature of the racism-calling business to imagine the worst in everybody. Like a prosecutor in a Kafka novel,
              the commissioner is deemed to possess extraordinary powers to examine the souls of others and expose the thought crimes
              within. To declare oneself innocent or suggest there&#x2019;s been a mistake is futile for, as Josef K was told in no
              uncertain terms, &#x201C;that is how the guilty speak&#x201D;.</p>
            <p>There are many reasons parliament should abolish clause 18C of the Race Discrimination Act, but the most compelling is that
              the Australian Human Rights Commission has its mitts on it.</p>
            <p>The commission&#x2019;s failure to kill off the sinister Queensland University of Technology case, in which students have
              been put through the mill for daring to object to being ejected from an indigenous-only computer room, shows that commissioner
              Gillian Triggs and her team have no regard for natural justice, let alone a sense of proportion.</p>
            <p>The chance that a complaint will be dismissed as wobbly is getting smaller every year. Of the 979 complaints finalised by
              the commission between 2001 and 2005 almost three in 10 were declared trivial, vexatious, frivolous, misconceived or
              lacking in substance.</p>
            <p>In the same period 10 years later, under presidents Catherine Branson and Triggs, the proportion dismissed as insubstantial
              was less than one in 20.</p>
            <p>The commissioners&#x2019; inclination to take the grimmest view imaginable of their fellow citizens &#x2014; those, at any
              rate, with white skin &#x2014; is at best uncharitable. At worst it suggests they are subject to the same hidebound prejudice
              they so freely identify in others. Why else would Soutphommasane believe the election of Pauline Hanson could trigger
              civil unrest? What else but prejudice would lead him to regard One Nation&#x2019;s white, non-university-educated voters
              with such condescension? A few choice words from the red-haired demagogue, apparently, and they&#x2019;ll be rioting
              in the streets. &#x201C;We have plenty of examples about how licensing hate can lead to serious violence and ugliness
              in our streets and our communities,&#x201D; Soutphommasane declared. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s great potential for harm
              to be done when you&#x2019;re talking about inflammatory rhetoric or appeals to xenophobia.&#x201D;</p>
            <p>His attempt to censor an elected politician seems impertinent, but in the racism-calling caper that&#x2019;s the way they
              think. Branson, in her farewell speech in 2012, said building a human rights culture was &#x201C;much too important to
              leave just to governments&#x201D;.</p>
            <p>To be condemned as a racist is one of the worst slurs one can cast on a fellow citizen, particularly when amplified by the
              pack-hunting boors on social media. Yet there is no presumption of innocence when one is hauled before the commission,
              despite the seriousness of the charges, nor any sense that the commissioners wish to be seen as impartial.</p>
            <p>It is all in a day&#x2019;s work for Soutphommasane, who warns: &#x201C;If you don&#x2019;t want to be called a racist or
              a bigot, you can start by not expressing a racist or bigoted opinion.&#x201D;</p>
            <p>In any other context he would be appalled at the kind of extrajudicial vilification he now practices. Indeed, in his former
              career as a humble columnist for this newspaper, he criticised the &#x201C;trial by media&#x201D; of former <i>Hey Dad!</i>    star Robert Hughes. Allegations of sexual molestation, published at length by <i>Woman&#x2019;s Day</i>, had &#x201C;all
              but guaranteed Hughes won&#x2019;t receive a fair trial&#x201D;.</p>
            <p>&#x201C;Justice is dispensed in the courtroom, not before some cameras in some TV studio, and certainly not in the pages
              of some trashy magazine,&#x201D; he wrote.</p>
            <p>Six years later the niceties of natural justice appear to trouble Soutphommasane somewhat less.</p>
            <p>He has no compunction towards prejudging his fellow citizens on whatever platform he is offered.</p>
            <p>When asked to comment by Fairfax about the latest controversy &#x2014; the one about a feckless Aboriginal father in a Bill
              Leak cartoon &#x2014; Soutphommasane happily goes in for the kill.</p>
            <p>&#x201C;Our society shouldn&#x2019;t endorse racial stereotyping of Aboriginal Australians or any other racial or ethnic
              group,&#x201D; he said.</p>
            <p>&#x201C;A significant number&#x201D; of people would agree the cartoon was a racial stereotype and he urged anyone who was
              offended by it to lodge a complaint under the Racial Discrimination Act.</p>
            <p>Thus the fears of those who opposed Gough Whitlam&#x2019;s Racial Discrimination Act legislation in 1975 have been fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Far from eliminating social tension, the Racial Discrimination Act&#x2019;s draconian measures have increased it.</p>
            <p>We have ended up, as former senator Glen Sheil warned, with an official race relations industry staffed by &#x201C;dedicated
              anti-racists earning their living by making the most of every complaint&#x201D;.</p>
            <p>Hughes, for the record, is serving a non-parole period of six years for paedophilia.</p>
            <p>His complaint that media coverage had prejudiced his trial was dismissed by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal last September.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile a fine cartoonist has had an unjustified slur cast over his name by a 33-year-old with a philosophy degree who
              is paid more than $6000 a week from the public purse.</p>
            <p>Soutphommasane should apologise.</p>
